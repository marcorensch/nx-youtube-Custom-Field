# nx-YouTube Custom Field
##### Joomla! Custom Field to display a youtube Video

The free Joomla! Plugin nx-YouTube Custom Field is a new Custom Form Field which allows you to effortlessly embed a YouTube Video before or after any of your Joomla! Articles (like every other Custom Field). And yes, as it should be in the Year 2017 Iâ€™m glad to tell you: its fully responsive. Compared to the most other YouTube Embed Plugin, nx-YouTube Custom Field offers you an additional set of options which can be quick configured for every Frontend Instance of the Plugin.
